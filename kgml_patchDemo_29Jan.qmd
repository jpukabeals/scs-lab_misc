# Retrofitting datasets for new analyses using a patch

Ideally, all of our data or at least core data (yield) is all in a database in the same format and can be pulled across trials. Reality is that each experiment exists as a silo.

## Master data

Master data is often structured so that each row is a unique site-year-plot with columns for every measurement from that plot and in a format that makes sense for collecting data in the field and processing across multiple steps in the lab.

Master data does not have a consistent format across experiments but is designed for the needs of the specific experiment

## Management data

Data like the planting date and fertilizer rate is kept in the fieldwork timeline. This data is then pulled from the fieldwork timeline into columns in the master document as needed. Most master files contain little to no management data

## Patches

Patches are files that allow for joining Master datasets with Management datasets.

A patch is like a key. It solves the problem of having to copy and paste identical data across reps/blocks which is both labor intensive and prone to error.

![Using patches, we can combine management data with master datasets into a dataset better structured to for analysis across experiments. KGML dataset could be swapped with orei_manure dataset or any other master dataset. ](kgml_patch_infographic.png)

# Code

## ORG

```{r import data}

library(tidyverse)

read.csv("kgml_data_29Jan.csv") -> masterDat
# master data, experiment-site-year-plot-yield

# csv didn't retain filter from google sheets, so filtering just for simplicity
masterDat %>% 
  filter(project == "ORG") -> masterDat

read.csv("kgml_managementData_29Jan.csv") -> managementDat
#management data, experiment-site-year-treatment-croptype

read.csv("kgml_treatmentPatch_29Jan.csv") -> trtPatch
# patch, allowing treatment numbers to be applied to plot numbers for a given experiment-site-year-plot-treatment


masterDat %>% 
  # distinct(year)
  mutate(site = fct_recode(location,
                           "st paul" = "St. Paul",
                           "lamberton" = "Lamberton",
                           "rosemount" = "Ros R54-55")) %>% 
  rename(experiment = project) -> masterDat2
# changing column names and factor values so identical terminologies used
  
trtPatch %>% 
  mutate(site = fct_recode(site,
                           "st paul" = "St. Paul",
                           "lamberton" = "Lamberton",
                           "rosemount" = "Ros R54-55")) -> trtPatch2
# changing column names and factor values so identical terminologies used

```

```{r simplifying}

managementDat %>% 
  filter(information == "Crop type") %>% 
  rename(crop = value) %>% 
  select(experiment, site, year, crop, treatment)  -> managementDat2
# changing column names for simplicity and clarity. 

masterDat2 %>% 
  select(experiment,site,year,plot,seedyld) -> masterDat3

masterDat3 %>% 
  glimpse() 

managementDat2 %>% 
  glimpse()

trtPatch2 %>% 
  glimpse()
```

```{r joining}

masterDat3 %>% 
  left_join(trtPatch2) %>% 
  left_join(managementDat2) %>% 
  arrange(plot,site,year) %>% 
  relocate(seedyld,.after=crop) %>% 
  slice(1:37)
```

## Orei manure

Here I created management data for orei and a treatment patch, I am now connecting just the seed yield data from the master into an improved dataset which I am printing below.

```{r}

read.csv("thesis_prepared_data - data_main.csv") -> masterDat_orei


read.csv("jesse_kgml_dataset.xlsx - treatment patch (3).csv") -> trtPatch_orei


read.csv("jesse_KGML_dataset.xlsx - Management data.csv") -> managementDat_orei

masterDat_orei %>% 
  filter(location=="MN") %>% 
  mutate(site = fct_recode(location,
                           rosemount = "MN")) %>% 
  mutate(
    experiment = "orei_manure",
    plot = reassigned_plot,
    seedyld = grain_yield_kg_ha_avg) %>% 
  relocate(c(experiment, site, year, plot, seedyld)) %>% 
  select(1:5)-> masterDat_orei2


managementDat_orei %>% 
  filter(information == "Crop type") %>% 
  rename(crop = value) %>% 
  select(experiment, site, year, crop, treatment)  -> managementDat_orei2


masterDat_orei2 %>% 
  left_join(trtPatch_orei) %>%
  left_join(managementDat_orei2) %>% 
  arrange(plot,site,year) %>% 
  relocate(seedyld,.after=crop) %>%
  select(-treatment) %>% 
  # filter(treatment.name != "NA") %>% 
  slice(1:25)

```

Now with bringing in more than just crop information

```{r}
managementDat_orei %>% 
  filter(information == "Crop type" |
           information == "N fertilizer rate") %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = information,
              values_from = value) %>% 
  select(experiment, site, year, `Crop type`, 
         `N fertilizer rate`, treatment)  -> managementDat_orei3

masterDat_orei2 %>% 
  left_join(trtPatch_orei) %>%
  left_join(managementDat_orei3) %>% 
  arrange(plot,site,year) %>% 
  relocate(seedyld,.after=`N fertilizer rate`) %>%
  select(-treatment) %>% 
  slice(1:25)

```
